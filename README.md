# Abstract

This research works on machine learning models to help in determining the customer
product purchases considering the history of customers. Our study uses a dataset
consisting of the purchase histories of clients which is used for developing and
accessing a Random Forest classifier. In this research, the Random Forest model
surpasses Naive Bayes classifiers, logistic regression, KNN, SVM, and decision trees
with exceptional accuracy. In this sort of problem, additional metrics and insights offer
a thorough understanding of Random Forest’s strong estimation capacity. The potential
of the ensemble learning algorithm to identify the significance of features, captivate
intricate trends, and withstand sound is one of its primary advantages that is examined.
The findings validate Random Forest’s efficiency as a forecasting spending statistics
solution and provide insightful advice to companies that are looking to maximize
predictive modelling for marketing campaigns. 

# Result 

While comparing a few Machine Learning Algorithms such as KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression, ID3, and Random Forest. Random Forest outperforms all other algorithms and gives the result with high accuracy.
