**Age** - Age is a crucial factor in predicting cardiovascular disease as the risk of developing CVD tends to increase with age. It is a non-modifiable risk factor, and older individuals are generally at a higher risk of heart-related issues.
**Sex** -  Gender is a non-modifiable risk factor. Males often have a higher risk of developing CVD compared to females. The hormonal differences between genders can contribute to variations in cardiovascular risk.
**CP (Chest Pain Type)** -  CP represents the type of chest pain experienced by an individual. Different types of chest pain may indicate varying levels of cardiac stress. For example, stable angina may be less severe than unstable angina or myocardial infarction (heart attack).
**Trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure)** - Resting blood pressure is a measure of the force of blood against the walls of the arteries when the heart is at rest. Elevated or high resting blood pressure is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and maintaining normal blood pressure levels is crucial.
**Chol (Serum Cholesterol)** - Serum cholesterol levels, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, are associated with the risk of developing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Maintaining optimal cholesterol levels is essential for heart health.
**Fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar)** - Elevated fasting blood sugar levels are indicative of insulin resistance and may contribute to diabetes, which is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Maintaining normal blood sugar levels is essential for heart health.
**Restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results)** - Resting ECG results provide information about the electrical activity of the heart at rest. Abnormal ECG findings may indicate cardiac abnormalities and contribute to the assessment of cardiovascular risk.
**Thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)** - Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise is an important parameter in assessing cardiovascular fitness. Abnormalities in maximum heart rate may indicate cardiac issues.
**Exang (Exercise-Induced Angina)** - The presence of angina (chest pain) during exercise is indicative of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It is an important symptom that may suggest underlying coronary artery disease.
**Oldpeak (ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest)** - ST depression on an electrocardiogram during exercise may indicate myocardial ischemia (inadequate blood flow to the heart). The depth of ST depression can provide information about the severity of ischemia.
**Slope (Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment)** - The slope of the ST segment during exercise can provide additional information about the severity and characteristics of exercise-induced changes in the electrocardiogram.
**Ca (Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy)** - The number of major vessels showing significant blood flow obstruction, as determined by fluoroscopy or other imaging techniques, is an important indicator of the extent of coronary artery disease.
**Thal (Thalassemia)** - Thalassemia is a genetic blood disorder that may affect the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin. In the context of cardiovascular disease prediction, thalassemia may be considered as it can impact overall health.

**Recommended Levels for a Healthy Life**

Age: Not applicable, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle throughout life is crucial.
Blood Pressure: Normal levels are around 120/80 mmHg. Blood pressure should be regularly monitored and managed.
Cholesterol: Total cholesterol should be less than 200 mg/dL. LDL cholesterol should be less than 100 mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol should be higher than 40 mg/dL for men and 50 mg/dL for women.
Blood Sugar: Fasting blood sugar should be less than 100 mg/dL. Regular monitoring and management are essential for those at risk of diabetes.
Maximum Heart Rate: The maximum heart rate can be estimated using the formula 220 - age. For cardiovascular fitness, aim for a target heart rate during exercise based on age and fitness level.
Body Mass Index (BMI): Maintain a healthy BMI between 18.5 and 24.9.
Exercise: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.
