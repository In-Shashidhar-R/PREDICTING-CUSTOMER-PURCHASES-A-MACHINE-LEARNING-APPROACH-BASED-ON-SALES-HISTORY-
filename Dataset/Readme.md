# About The Dataset

The customer’s purchase history dataset comprises of 2500 rows and 7 columns which consist of Customer ID, Gender , Age, Salary, Product ID, Price and whether the product has been purchased or not indicated by 0 or 1, 0 stating the product was not purchased and 1 if the product was purchased. These are the attributes that are used for identifying every customer’s previous purchase history. Each customer’s purchase history is represented by each row and each attribute in that row shows a distinct identifier. 
The dataset makes statistical analysis possible, which involves correlation parameters, gender distribution , and qualitative explanations. 
Furthermore, it makes it easier to calculate the ratios of both male and female customers to have a better understanding of their purchase behaviours. Considering every aspect the dataset offers significant information on customer behaviour and possible purchase trends.
